# Metis Module 1: EDA
My first taste of data science. For this project, I utilized NYC MTA turnstile data to pinpoint residents with high risk of exposure to 
contagious diseases based on their commutes. The analysis was performed using Python, SQL, and Tableau. 
Findings were communicated in a 5-minute presentation for the Metis team.
